This site is deployed with Netlify.

Visit the GitHub repo for the site [here](https://github.com/philthehuman/portfolio-website).

## Purpose

This portfolio site is built to be a virtual resume for prospective employers.
Not only does it contain detailed information about myself, my resume, contact details and social networks, it is also in and of itself a display of my web development abilities.
It is built from the ground up to work well on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Features

### About me
The home page contains information on my development skills and includes an elevator pitch of my abilities.
It also has a picture of myself to make the site feel more personal, and a call to action (hire me button).

Listed at the bottom of the page is a brief overview of my resume including qualifications, work history, interests along with a link to download my full resume.
### Portfolio
The portfolio page is an aesthetically pleasing place for me to list any relevant project I've worked on. This helps display my best work to prospective employers.

### Contact
The contact me page has a form that lets employers, clients or fellow programmers contact me directly. It has smart input fields (phone must be a number, email must be an email) and requires certain fields to be filled before it can be submitted. There is a visually modified radio button at the top of the form that allows clients to request a job, along with an option for general enquiries.
